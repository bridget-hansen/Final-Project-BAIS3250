# Cleaning and County Vehicle Data Code

## Contents
This folder contains the Jupyter Notebook Titled Cleaning Vehicle Data and Calculating Total Fuel Percentage. This notebook contains the code I used to read in The Excel File I obtained from Data.gov. In addition to this notebook the CSV file that this dataset was saved to is also located in this folder. In order to upload the orginal Excel File I deleted all of the sheets except the one that I used in my code.
