# Population Data

## Contents 
This folder contains all of the Excel files that I saved from the U.S Census Website. I renamed each orginal file to "State name.xlsx". Some of the states are missing because my Webscraping code was not able to scrape all 50 states. In addition to these Excel Files I have uploaded the code I wrote to extract data by reading each file in using a for loop. This code was written in a Jupyter Notebook called Population Data Code. In addtion to the Jupyter Notebook the CSV file that this data was saved to is also located within this folder.
