# Jupyter Notebook and CSV folder

## Contents 
To allow an easier access to the code used to read in all of the Excel Files saved in the Population Data folder, I have added this folder which contains my Jupyter Notebook with a for loop for reading in all the Excel files. In additon to the Jupyter Notebook, I have also uploaded the CSV file this data was saved to and this file is called pop data.csv.
