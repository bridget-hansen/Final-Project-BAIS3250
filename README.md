## Final Project
This project is for my final and consited of webscraping data, integrating dataframes and using modes of analysis like hypothesis tests and machine learning to evaluate questions for my analysis. My project is focused on viewing electric vehicle data at a county level and the correlation with voting habits in those counties.

## Files used 
There were three main datasets used for this final project. One was the 2016 Presidental Elections reults that I obtained through scraping The New York Times Website found below. The second, was obtained through Data.gov and it describes county vehicle registrations by fuel type, the link is also below. Lastly, the third dataset was obtained through the U.S Census website, which is also found below.

## File Structure
The file structure of this repository is split up based on the phases of my project. The first phase was Webscraping, and there is a folder called Webscraping. The second phase was reading in and cleaning the Data.gov file, and there is a folder called County Vehcile Data. The third phase was obtaining population data, there is a folder called Population Data. The fourth phase was integreating these datasets and there is a folder called Integrating Data. More information about what these folders contain can be found in the readme file located in these folders.
